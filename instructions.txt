# Engineer OnDemand
## Rent our Engineers by the minute

Our service revolves around us installing an engineer in co working spaces around town - these engineer are not contractors, they are the founders of the company.

The people and companies in the co working space can then get a quick engineer to look at a problem for them, build something, test something, prepare them something technical, etc. And no need to hire or track time. Its simple. Its local.

We all wear hoodies and shirts and hats that say things that get attention - our engineer will be at their seat, so the top back of their shirt/hoodie will be visible. On the table next to them is a stack of cards. Each piece of clothing and on the card has a QR code - thats what brings them to the page you are about to build.

each page is a whole viewport - scrolling up and down is react scroll and we have a Section component, the section component handles the full viewport display, macbook or big pc monitor.

we need a react schedule component and the data wil be in mongodb: (.env.local)

There will be a collection "appointments" and a collection "engineers" (users) and the timezone is ALWAYS the location of the person browsing the website. (by geoloc)

engineers have a way to add their availabilities, skills, rates, and accept appointment requests from an app ON THEIR PHONE

This app will read the appointments that engineer already acepted and not let them be double booked. double booking prevention is also from the "pending" status. 2 people cant request the same day/time

from this single page app - the end user (people requesting the engineer) only sees the engineers in their location which for now is a zip code and mile radius number.

if we have no engineer within 50 miles of them, they cannot book any appointments.

Make it pretty -  think the Stripe landing pages, but in Dark mode and with our content. Youbuild:

- the homepage (hero, how it works, location specific content, footer
- the location specific content:
-- if we have an egineer in the engineers collection with a location and within the range of the engineer's preference - they see the booking section. Otherwise they see a request early access CTA with email/db storage of the info we collect.
- make it clean - do not do stupid borders everywhere. this is for people hiring engineers, not engineers! make it beautiful

THIS IS A FUCKING APP FOR CO WORKING SPACES! WE HAVE ENGINEERS IN THESE SPACES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT MAKE IT SOUND LIKE SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL TO HELP!
